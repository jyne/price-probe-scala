# price-probe-scala
Price Probe Scala is a middleware born to make sensed queries to serve nice and dry data.

## Todos
 - [ ] Build a swagger with [swagger-ui](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) containing the REST points of the application
 - [ ] Build some test endpoints like: 
    - `-X GET /item/id`
    - `-X GET /item/name`
    - `-X GET /item/description`
    - `-X POST /item/`
    - `-X PUT /item/`
    - `-X DELETE /item/`
 - [ ] Setup ElasticSearch. Take a look at [olivere/elastic](https://github.com/olivere/elastic)
 - [ ] Talk with ElasticSearch
 - [ ] Setup Redis for caching. Most of things are already done at [Go-Todo-List](https://github.com/AndreaM16/Go-Todo-List)
 - [ ] Actually store/serve/edit/delete data
 - [ ] Build solid search queries
        
## To Check
 - [ ] Check [sangria-graphql](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria) to actually build REST endpoints.
